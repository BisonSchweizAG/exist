This version of appbundler is taken from https://github.com/TheInfiniteKind/appbundler (rev. b42e147). This project fixes a number of issues with the original appbundler, https://java.net/projects/appbundler.

TheInfiniteKind only provides source code for appbundler, no releases, so the eXist-db project has to create its own build.

The current binary `lib/appbundler-20190531.jar` was built by Joe Wicentowski on May 31, 2019 using rev. b42e147, Oracle JDK 1.8.0_211-b12, and xcrun version 43 on macOS 10.13. (The xcrun tool and all that is needed to compile appbuilder is included the Xcode Command Line Tools, which can be installed via `xcode-select --install`; a full installation of Xcode is not necessary.)
